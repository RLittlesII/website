Cake is a build automation system with a C# DSL to do things like compiling code, copy files/folders, running unit tests, compress files and build NuGet packages.

Cake uses a [dependency based programming model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/rake.html#DependencyBasedProgramming) just like Rake, FAKE and similar build automation systems where you declare tasks and the dependencies between those.
